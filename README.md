# f1_tyre_wear_rate_pred
A personal project to predict tyre wear rate in F1 using a Reccurent neural network model, in addition to setting up an ETL pipeline to transform a dataset

# IMPORTANT UPDATE
This project has been terminated. Although it was a difficult decision, I had to stop it due to its heavy resource demands. Running the project either fills up my computerâ€™s storage or requires costly cloud services, which I cannot afford at the moment due to financial constraints caused by joblessness.

I hope to revisit it in the future when I have access to better resources.
